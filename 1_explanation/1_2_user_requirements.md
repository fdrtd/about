# user requirements

while elegant in theory, it has proven quite difficult to provide practical implementations and demonstrate use cases.
proposing the technology to potential users often creates a lot of interest at first but little traction in following
up. while CEOs and CTOs are typically in favour, CIOs, CSAs and developers tend to have reservations. they may claim
the technology ...

* was **complex** and **intransparent**
* was built on **monolithic** code
* was **demanding** in terms of computing power
* required very **specific** runtimes
* required **exotic** developer skills
* was **cumbersome** to develop and operate
* did not provide a standardized interface
* did not integrate well into **legacy** ecosystems
* was targeted at **academic** crypto experts

talking to decision makers and stakeholders quickly reveals that quite the opposite is desired:

* they want to solve **specific problems** and did not care about universality
* their problems are typically **quite simple** in algorithmic terms
* they do not have any crypto experts and rely on **generalist developers**
* their **data protection** officers are sceptical about novel methods
* they need a **precise standard** that could be referenced in legal documents
* they need a prototyping approach that was up to speed with their **CI/CD**
* they want a framework that was as **simple** as possible to operate and service
* they want to **collaborate** with others who had very different systems
* they want to choose **their own language** and development environments
* they need the new methods to be integrated **step-by-step** into legacy code

thus it quickly became clear that what was needed was **not another framework**
but rather some **middleware** that would help to develop for existing
frameworks and help to deploy and maintain solutions in a more convenient way.
