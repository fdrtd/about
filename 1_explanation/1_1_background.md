# background: advantages of privacy-preserving computation

privacy-preserving computation technologies such as 
[secure multiparty computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) or 
[homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) 
are interesting and active topics in cryptography research.

through secure protocols, they enable a number of parties to jointly compute a function
without revealing their private inputs to each other or a third party.

the usually conflicting goals of collaboration and data protection are thus reconciled
by avoiding data sharing in the first place.
